        A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more
        than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion
        of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where
        new stars are beginning to form.

      <p>
        Star-forming regions are a class of emission nebula associated with
        giant molecular clouds. These form as a molecular cloud collapses under
        its own weight, producing stars. Massive stars may form in the center,
        and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it
        visible at optical wavelengths. The region of ionized hydrogen
        surrounding the massive stars is known as an H II region while the
        shells of neutral hydrogen surrounding the H II region are known as
        photodissociation region. Examples of star-forming regions are the Orion
        Nebula, the Rosette Nebula and the Omega Nebula. Feedback from
        star-formation, in the form of supernova explosions of massive stars,
        stellar winds or ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, or outflows
        from low-mass stars may disrupt the cloud, destroying the nebula after
        several million years.

      <p>
        Other nebulae form as the result of supernova explosions; the death
        throes of massive, short-lived stars. The materials thrown off from the
        supernova explosion are then ionized by the energy and the compact
        object that its core produces. One of the best examples of this is the
        Crab Nebula, in Taurus. The supernova event was recorded in the year
        1054 and is labeled SN 1054. The compact object that was created after
        the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and its core is now
        a neutron star.

    <section>
      <p>
        Still other nebulae form as planetary nebulae. This is the final stage
        of a low-mass star's life, like Earth's Sun. Stars with a mass up to
        8â€“10 solar masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer
        layers during pulsations in their atmospheres. When a star has lost
        enough material, its temperature increases and the ultraviolet radiation
        it emits can ionize the surrounding nebula that it has thrown off. Our
        Sun will produce a planetary nebula and its core will remain behind in
        the form of a white dwarf.
